I've decided to start a blog site. I write documentation and tutorials for friends and at work, and if the information is general enough to be helpful to others, why not share?

I am making an effort to get more involved with GitHub, and I already prefer writing docs in Markdown, so Jekyll was a no-brainer.

More to come soon, I hope.
