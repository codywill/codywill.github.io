This is the first in a series of posts focused on achieving a high level of unit test coverage for C/C++ projects. I haven't seen many resources for learning how to bring embedded code under test, so the examples I use will largely focus on embedded code. That said, the process and tooling should be general enough to cover just about any C or C++ project.

<!--excerpt--> 

The tools I have chosen are very easy to work with - two single-header frameworks, CMake, and a GNU compiler. I have made an effort to ensure this process is straightforward enough to be automated with a simple script and flexible enough to be applied to a variety of projects.

In this tutorial, we will prepare a test environment and write our first tests for a flash driver that depends on the STM32 Standard Peripheral Library.

Requirements: 
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch)
- [fff](https://github.com/meekrosoft/fff)
- GNU Compiler ([MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) is used for the examples in this document)

## Project Structure
Since we will be injecting our test suite into an existing project, the structure should end up looking something like this:
- existing project/
    - src/
    - test/
        - build/
        - include/
            - *.h
            - *.fakes.h
        - lib/
            - catch.hpp
            - fff.h
        - tests/
            - coverage.cpp
            - *.test.cpp
            - *.fakes.c
        - CMakeLists.txt
        - test_main.cpp

# Part 1: Preparing your test environment
In `project`
- Create a `test` directory alongside your `src` directory.

In `test`
- Create `build`, `include`, `lib`, and `tests` directories.
- Copy `catch.hpp` and `fff.h` to `lib`.
- Create `CMakeLists.txt` containing the following:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8 FATAL_ERROR)

add_library(Frameworks INTERFACE)
add_library(Includes INTERFACE)
add_library(Source INTERFACE)

target_include_directories(Frameworks INTERFACE ./lib)
target_include_directories(Includes INTERFACE ./include)
target_include_directories(Source INTERFACE ../src)

file(GLOB SOURCES 
"test_main.cpp" 
"./tests/*.cpp" 
"./tests/*.c"
)
add_executable(run ${SOURCES})

target_link_libraries(run 
Frameworks 
Includes
Source
)
```

- Create `test_main.cpp` containing the following:

```cpp
// test_main.cpp
#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN
#include "catch.hpp"
```

In `tests`
- Create `coverage.cpp` containing the following:

```cpp
// fff header
#include "fff.h"
DEFINE_FFF_GLOBALS

// source files covered
extern "C" {

}
```

# Part 2: Including a file in the test suite
After choosing a file to be put under test, it must be included in the test suite.

For the examples in this document, we will use `flash_if.c`.

- Create `tests/flash_if.test.cpp` containing the following:

```cpp
// flash_if.test.cpp
extern "C" {
#include "flash_if.h"
}
#include "catch.hpp"
```

- Include the file in `capture.cpp`, wrapped in `extern "C"` if necessary:

```cpp
// source files covered
extern "C" {
#include "flash_if.c"
}
```

# Part 3: Check and stub dependencies
At this point, we can attempt to build the test suite.

Navigate to `build`

Run CMake with the appropriate output to generate the makefile:

```powershell
> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
```

Run make to attempt the build:

```powershell
> mingw32-make
```

You should see the following error:

```powershell
stm32f4xx_flash.h: No such file or directory
 #include "stm32f4xx_flash.h"
```

Our test suite does not include the library on which `flash_if.c` depends (standard peripheral library), so we must create our own test double for the included file.

Navigate to `include` and create `stm32f4xx_flash.h` containing the following:

```cpp
#ifndef __STM32F4XX_FLASH_H__
#define __STM32F4XX_FLASH_H__

#endif //__STM32F4XX_FLASH_H__
```

Attempting to build again should result in a number of errors complaining about undeclared items. Starting from the top, we begin defining them in our test double one at a time, attempting to build with each step. Looking up declarations in the actual library can be helpful for matching the expected behavior.

**It is important to avoid mass copying/pasting from the library, as this can introduce more issues that may be very hard to diagnose. One at a time!**

```cpp
#ifndef __STM32F4XX_FLASH_H__
#define __STM32F4XX_FLASH_H__

#include <stdint.h>

#define FLASH_Sector_0     ((uint16_t)0x0000)
#define FLASH_Sector_1     ((uint16_t)0x0008)
#define FLASH_Sector_2     ((uint16_t)0x0010)
#define FLASH_Sector_3     ((uint16_t)0x0018)
#define FLASH_Sector_4     ((uint16_t)0x0020)
#define FLASH_Sector_5     ((uint16_t)0x0028)
#define FLASH_Sector_6     ((uint16_t)0x0030)
#define FLASH_Sector_7     ((uint16_t)0x0038)
#define FLASH_Sector_8     ((uint16_t)0x0040)
#define FLASH_Sector_9     ((uint16_t)0x0048)
#define FLASH_Sector_10    ((uint16_t)0x0050)
#define FLASH_Sector_11    ((uint16_t)0x0058)

#define FLASH_COMPLETE 8

#define VoltageRange_3 (uint8_t)0x02

void FLASH_Unlock(void);
uint8_t FLASH_EraseSector(unsigned short sector, unsigned int voltage);
uint8_t FLASH_ProgramWord(unsigned int address, unsigned int data);

#endif //__STM32F4XX_FLASH_H__
```

Once all of the dependencies are declared in our test double, make should result in linker errors instead, which is exactly what we want:

```powershell
CMakeFiles\run.dir/objects.a(coverage.cpp.obj):coverage.cpp:(.text+0x1f4): undefined reference to 'FLASH_Unlock'
CMakeFiles\run.dir/objects.a(coverage.cpp.obj):coverage.cpp:(.text+0x24b): undefined reference to 'FLASH_EraseSector'
CMakeFiles\run.dir/objects.a(coverage.cpp.obj):coverage.cpp:(.text+0x2d2): undefined reference to 'FLASH_ProgramWord'
collect2.exe: error: ld returned 1 exit status
CMakeFiles\run.dir\build.make:150: recipe for target 'run.exe' failed
mingw32-make[2]: *** [run.exe] Error 1
CMakeFiles\Makefile2:66: recipe for target 'CMakeFiles/run.dir/all' failed
mingw32-make[1]: *** [CMakeFiles/run.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:82: recipe for target 'all' failed
mingw32-make: *** [all] Error 2
```

# Part 4: Generating fake function implementation

This is where fff comes in. To utilize fff, a source and header file must be created for the test double, which is `stm32f4xx_flash.h` in our case.

Create `include/stm32f4xx_flash.fakes.h` containing the following:

```cpp
#include "stm32f4xx_flash.h"
#include "fff.h"

FAKE_VOID_FUNCTION(FLASH_Unlock);
FAKE_VALUE_FUNCTION(uint8_t, FLASH_EraseSector, unsigned short, unsigned int);
FAKE_VALUE_FUNCTION(uint8_t, FLASH_ProgramWord, unsigned int, unsigned int);
```

- The `FAKE FUNCTION` calls are written according to the function to be implemented. 

- `FAKE_VOID_FUNCTION` generates implementation for a void function, with the first argument indicating the function name and subsequent arguments indicating any arguments for the real function. In the case of `FLASH_Unlock`, there are no arguments so only the function name is provided.

- `FAKE_VALUE_FUNCTION` generates implementation for a function with a defined return type. The first argument is the return type, followed by the function name and other arguments.

- See [fff on github](https://github.com/meekrosoft/fff) for more documentation.

Next, create `test/tests/stm32f4xx_flash.fakes.c` containing the following:

```cpp
#include "stm32f4xx_flash.fakes.h"
#define GENERATE_FAKES
#include "stm32f4xx_flash.fakes.h"
```

The `*.fakes.c` file will always look like this, with two inclusions of the header sandwiching the `GENERATE_FAKES` definition.

Finally, add `stm32f4xx_flash.fakes.h` to the c includes in `flash_if.test.cpp`:

```cpp
// flash_if.test.cpp
extern "C" {
#include "flash_if.h"
#include "stm32f4xx_flash.fakes.h"
}
#include "catch.hpp"
```

Navigate to `build` and run CMake again since we added some new files:

```powershell
> cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..
```

...and make once more. It should now build!

```powershell
> mingw32-make

```

# Part 5: Testing with fake functions
All tests should be written in the `*.test.cpp` file matched to the file under test, or `flash_if.test.cpp` for our example.

Writing tests using Catch can follow one of two patterns: `TEST_CASE` declarations, or `GIVEN`, `WHEN`, `THEN` BDD-style declarations. See the [Catch tutorial](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md) for more details.

For this example we will be using the BDD-style test format.

Let's say in my `flash_if.c` there is a very basic function called `FLASH_If_Init()` whose sole purpose is to call `FLASH_Unlock()`, one of our fakes. We'll start by writing a test for `FLASH_If_Init()`:

```cpp
SCENARIO("Initialize flash", "[FLASH_If_Init]") {
  GIVEN("The flash driver has not been initialized") {
    WHEN("The flash driver is initialized") {
      FLASH_If_Init();
      THEN("FLASH_Unlock is called") {
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Any test that uses fff should at some point call `FFF_RESET;` to prevent interference between tests. We'll put it before `GIVEN` is called.

Since our test will only check whether `FLASH_Unlock` was called, we will check that at the end of the test the fake function call count is equal to 1.

**NOTE: Prefer `CHECK` over `REQUIRE` when asserting against fake functions, otherwise the test suite will abort on a failure.**

Our finished test:

```cpp
SCENARIO("Initialize flash", "[FLASH_If_Init]") {
  FFF_RESET;
  GIVEN("The flash driver has not been initialized") {
    WHEN("The flash driver is initialized") {
      FLASH_If_Init();
      THEN("FLASH_Unlock is called") {
        CHECK(1 == FLASH_Unlock_fake.call_count);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Build the suite again and run the executable (`run.exe` based on our `CMakeFiles.txt`) to see the test output:

```powershell
> ./run.exe
===============================================================================
All tests passed (1 assertion in 1 test case)
```

For our next test we will demonstrate a `FAKE_VALUE_FUNCTION` behavior by testing `FLASH_If_Erase`, which erases all sectors from a given address to a defined upper limit. This function calls `FLASH_EraseSector`, which will return `FLASH_COMPLETE` on successful erase.

We're only concerned with the behavior of `FLASH_If_Erase`, so faking our dependency on `FLASH_EraseSector` is as simple as choosing what it will return when it's called. This is done by assigning a value to `FLASH_EraseSector_fake.return_val`.

For this example, we'll test the case where flashing is successful starting at the address of sector 0. The defined upper limit is sector 4, so we expect our test to call `FLASH_EraseSector` 5 times and return 0 when complete to indicate no errors.

Our finished test:

```cpp
SCENARIO("Erase flash starting at known sector within limits", "[FLASH_If_Erase]") {
  FFF_RESET;
  GIVEN("The address for flash sector 0 is chosen") {
    uint32_t addr = 0x08000000;
    FLASH_EraseSector_fake.return_val = FLASH_COMPLETE;
    WHEN("Flash is erased starting at sector 0") {
      uint8_t retVal = FLASH_If_Erase(addr);
      THEN("Should call FLASH_EraseSector 5 times and return 0") {
        CHECK(5 == FLASH_EraseSector_fake.call_count);
        CHECK(0 == retVal);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Rebuilding and running our suite will yield the following:

```powershell
> ./run
===============================================================================
All tests passed (3 assertions in 2 test cases)
```

That's it! You now have your test environment set up and your first tests written. When it comes time to add more files, simply repeat parts 2-4 as needed.
