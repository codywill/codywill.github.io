<h1>About Me</h1>
<div class="about">
Hello!
<br><br>
My name is Cody. I enjoy writing software and working out ways to make the process more fun. Sometimes that means automating some of the boring parts, sometimes it means experimenting with new tools and frameworks. I spend a lot of time exploring various ways to write code and improve my process, and enjoy sharing techniques I particularly like with my friends and coworkers.
<br><br>
I work for a small aerospace company in Southern California contributing to software, electronics, and integrated systems development.
<br><br>
In my free time I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my wife and our pets.
